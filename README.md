# Starting-Up
As the App made is dynamic and depends upon the values added in the databse design. So to add different business domains which keeps on increasing with this evolving tech world, we had to make another app for the same project only for admin.

# Add Business Domain
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the appropriate JDK for your system.
3. Install Android Studio.
4. Import the project. Open Android Studio, click Open an existing Android Studio project and select the project. Gradle will build the project.
5. Run the app. Click Run > Run 'app'. After the project builds you'll be prompted to build or launch an emulator.
